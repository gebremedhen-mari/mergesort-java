# Mergesort in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Mergesort algorithm using `LinkedList`.  
It demonstrates understanding of recursion, linked lists, and sorting algorithms, and is designed for educational purposes.

## Features

- Sorts a list of integers using Mergesort
- Implements splitting, recursive sorting, and merging
- Uses `LinkedList` to practice data structures in Java
- Prints both the original and sorted list
